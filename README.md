Fog Setup: The glEnable(GL_FOG); enables fog, and glFogf() functions configure its color, density, and quality.
Camera and Perspective: The camera is set to look at the scene from a specific angle and distance, and the perspective projection ensures objects appear 3D.
Object Drawing: A teapot is drawn to show how fog fades objects based on their distance from the camera.
This code should create a simple scene with fog applied to a teapot model. The fog will thicken with distance, giving a realistic effect.

Note:
To run this code, make sure you have a C++ compiler set up with OpenGL and GLUT, as these libraries are necessary for 3D rendering. If you'd like more advanced fog rendering, incorporating ray tracing techniques or using a framework like Blenderâ€™s scripting API might be better suited to producing realistic fog images.
